Thank you so much for expressing interest to support Global Village for Hope!

My name is Linus Lin, a Singaporean who started my philanthropic work in Myanmar in August 2013. It started off as a one-man-show, literally! Every 2 months, I will take time off from my work and travel to remote areas in Myanmar, in search of places which I could add value to, as a backpacker. In November 2014, Joseph, a local Myanmar English tutor and translator, decided to join me in my philanthropic work. Together, we created 'Global Village For Hope'! I launched the GVH facebook page and trademarked the GVH logo shortly after. 'Global Village for Hope' was registered as a charitable foundation in Singapore, starting June 2019 and the www.gvh.sg website was launched in September 2018 (You must have come across it by now!). In August 2019, together with a team of passionate volunteers, we started a management committee known as the 'GVH Pulse ExCo', which consists of 26 volunteers who operate the GVH Foundation together.

GVH has grown organically over the years, mainly because of supporters like yourself, who responded to our stories on Facebook, heard about us from a friend and decided to partner us in doing some good for humanity.

I sincerely thank you for offering your help! Please refer to the following instructions on how to make your contribution to GVH. Once we have received your fund, we will send an acknowledgement to you. Kindly be patient and allow us some time to respond, as the GVH team in Singapore is operated purely by volunteers who have their own regular jobs too! 

Also, if you are keen to volunteer with us, do fill in the online volunteer form here too! Thank you once again :)
